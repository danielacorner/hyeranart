title: "ENERGY & FREEDOM"
Image: Life Is
body: "The proceedings of our daily events - the stories in our lives - are coordinated by various forces. These non-objective and abstract expressionist works represent two essential, yet opposing forces of life: the powerful and the weak. They aim to present the characteristics of metaphysical energy, such as flow, movement, freedom, through contrast of value, colour, space, and varying gesture lines. It is an expression of life through imagery."
