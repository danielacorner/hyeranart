  Expansive as the Sky


  The ethereal, ever-changing nature of a cloud-filled sky entrances artists as they seek to capture its elusive beauty and infinite palette of colors. Experience the limitless expanse of celestial realms through original artwork.


  I am really excited about having been featured my works in the ‘Expansive as the Sky’ collection.\
