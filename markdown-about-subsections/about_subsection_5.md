  Like her inspirations, Joan Mitchelle, Willem de Kooning, and Richard
  Diebenkorn, she likes working with new ways, working differently from
  traditional ways of painting and breaking rules. Many of her paintings break
  the traditional rule of having the point of interest in the center of the
  canvas and instead incorporates those points of interests in the edges of the
  canvas. Hyeran is an explorer, a challenger and a risk-taker.
